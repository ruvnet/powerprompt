# A few notes on using Power Prompt for ChatGPT and OpenAi.

## How do I get going?
Sign up for an OpenAI account: To use the Power Prompt Chrome extension, you'll need to sign up for an OpenAI account and obtain an API key. You can sign up for an OpenAI account at https://beta.openai.com/signup.

Enter your OpenAI API key: Once you've signed up for an OpenAI account and obtained your API key, you can enter it into the Power Prompt Chrome extension (top left when you visit https://chat.openai.com). To do this, navigate to the options page of the extension and look for the input field labeled "API Key." Enter your API key in this field and save your changes.

## Installing the pre-release version.
To install a Chrome extension that is not in the Chrome Web Store, you can use the following steps:

Download the extension file: If the extension is not available in the Chrome Web Store, you may need to download the extension file from a trusted source. You should only download extensions from trusted sources to avoid malware and security issues.

Open Chrome: Open Google Chrome and click the three dots in the upper-right corner to open the menu.

Go to "More tools" and then "Extensions": From the menu, select "More tools" and then "Extensions".

Enable "Developer mode": On the extensions page, you should see a toggle switch labeled "Developer mode" in the upper-right corner. Turn this switch on.

Download the latest release > https://github.com/ruvnet/powerprompt/blob/main/downloads/

Load the extension: Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder that contains the extension you downloaded in step 1.

Confirm installation: Chrome will display a warning that the extension is not from the Chrome Web Store and that it could harm your computer. If you trust the source of the extension, click "Add extension" to install it.

Use the extension: Once the extension is installed, you should be able to use it in Chrome. If the extension does not work as expected, you may need to contact the developer or find a different source for the extension.

Note: Installing extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store is not recommended and can pose a security risk. You should only install extensions from trusted sources and be cautious when installing extensions from unknown sources.

## Using Power Prompt

Choose a model: Power Prompt allows you to choose from different models to use with ChatGPT. The available models include GPT-3, GPT-3 Sandbox, and other language models developed by OpenAI. To choose a model, navigate to the options page of the extension and look for the dropdown menu labeled "Model." Select the desired model from the list of options.

Note: The different models available for use with Power Prompt may vary based on your OpenAI account type and the current status of the OpenAI platform. Some models may require additional permissions or credits to use, so be sure to check the OpenAI documentation for more information on the available models and their requirements.

## Using Power Prompt
Temperature, tokens, and prompt length are parameters that you can set when using the OpenAI API to generate text completions with the ChatGPT language model. Here's what each of these parameters does:

Temperature: The temperature parameter controls the randomness or creativity of the generated text. A lower temperature will result in more predictable and conservative text completions, while a higher temperature will result in more unpredictable and creative text completions.

Tokens: The tokens parameter controls the maximum length of the generated text. The token count is the number of words or phrases that will be generated by the API.

Prompt Length: The prompt length parameter controls the maximum length of the input text that you provide to the API. The prompt length can be set to any value within a certain range, and it determines the maximum length of the input text that you can provide to the API.

## Prompt Templates
A prompt template is a pre-written or pre-formatted text that you can use as input for the OpenAI API when generating text completions with the ChatGPT language model. Prompt templates are useful because they allow you to quickly and easily generate text completions for specific use cases, without having to manually type out the input text each time.

There are many different use cases for prompt templates, including:

Code: For developers, a code prompt template could include syntax or code snippets that are used frequently in their work. By using a code prompt template, developers can quickly generate text completions that follow the correct syntax and structure, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.

Legal: For lawyers and legal professionals, a legal prompt template could include legal terminology and language that is specific to their field. By using a legal prompt template, legal professionals can quickly generate text completions that use the correct legal language and terminology, saving time and improving the accuracy of their work.

Marketing: For marketers and content creators, a marketing prompt template could include language and terminology that is specific to their industry. By using a marketing prompt template, marketers and content creators can quickly generate text completions that use the correct language and terminology, saving time and improving the quality of their work.

These are just a few examples of how prompt templates can be used in different use cases. By using prompt templates, you can streamline your workflow, save time, and improve the accuracy and quality of your text completions generated by the OpenAI API.

By setting these parameters, you can customize the text completions generated by the OpenAI API to meet your specific needs and requirements. The optimal values for these parameters will depend on the specific use case and desired outcome, so it may take some experimentation to find the best values for your specific needs.

## Power Prompt Beta
As a beta version, Power Prompt is still undergoing development and improvement, and there may be some upcoming fixes and updates to the extension including better prompt templates. However, this beta version is still a fully functional and powerful tool for content creators, researchers, and anyone looking to have fun with ChatGPT. Our roadmap for future development includes adding new features and improvements to enhance the user experience and maximize the potential of the ChatGPT language model.

## Storage of your API Key
The Power Prompt extension requires the 'storage' permission to securely store the OpenAI API keys and related data fields such as token length and model in local storage. This ensures that the user's data is protected and readily available for subsequent use. The 'storage' permission is necessary to fulfill the single purpose of the extension, which is to provide a seamless and efficient interaction with the ChatGPT language model. No other permissions are required to fulfill this purpose. Only you will be able to see this key.

## Access to ChatGPT Website. 
The Power Prompt extension requires the host permission for chat.openai.com to access the necessary resources on the ChatGPT website. This permission is specified in the "permissions" and "content_scripts" fields of the extension manifest and is necessary to fulfill the single purpose of the extension, which is to provide a seamless and efficient interaction with the ChatGPT language model. The host permission for chat.openai.com allows the extension to interact with the resources on the ChatGPT website, ensuring that the user's experience is optimal
